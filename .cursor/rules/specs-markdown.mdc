# Docs markdown — minimal until complete

When editing or creating files under `docs/**/*.md`:

- **Prefer short content:** Use bullet lists and one-line summaries instead of long paragraphs.
- **Mark incomplete sections:** Use `TBD`, `(expand when complete)`, or a short placeholder instead of filling with filler.
- **Optional status:** For draft specs, add at the top: `> **Status:** Draft. Sections may be TBD.`
- **Expand later:** When a section is ready, replace placeholders with full prose and examples.
- Avoid adding verbose explanations or repeated context; link to other docs or the main README instead.
