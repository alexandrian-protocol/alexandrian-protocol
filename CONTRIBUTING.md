# Contributing

## Getting started

- **Requirements:** Node.js 20 (LTS), pnpm.
- **One command:** From repo root, `pnpm start:here` (install → build → demo).
- **Full check:** `pnpm verify` (build + all tests + demo).

See [README.md](README.md) and [docs/milestones/](docs/milestones/) for reviewer entry and commands.

## Submitting changes

1. Open an issue or pick an existing one.
2. Branch from `main`, make changes, run `pnpm verify` locally.
3. Open a pull request. CI runs build and tests on push.

## Commit history

Keep history clean: no secrets, no generated artifacts. If you use Cursor (or similar), disable **“Add co-author to commits”** in settings so commit messages stay minimal.
