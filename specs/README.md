# Specs

Protocol and project documentation. Layout: top-level specs, [grants/](grants/) (reviewer entry), [m2/](m2/) (Sepolia, roadmap, video script).

## Spec style — keep minimal until complete

- **Incomplete specs:** Prefer short bullets and one-line summaries. Use `TBD` or `(expand when complete)` for sections not yet written.
- **Status line (optional):** At the top of a draft spec, add: `> **Status:** Draft. Sections may be TBD.`
- **Complete specs:** Expand into full prose and examples when the content is ready.
- Avoid long paragraphs in early drafts; use lists and subheadings so structure is clear and gaps are obvious.
