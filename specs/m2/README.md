# M2 — Future work only

**This folder is planned work, not built.** Nothing here is required for M1. Nothing here bleeds back into M1 deliverables.

---

## Planned

- **Slash / deprecation** — KBStaking, deprecateKB, KBDeprecated, supersededBy (skeletons in `packages/protocol/contracts/m2/`)
- **Query metrics** — queryCount, totalFeesEarned in subgraph (snippets in `subgraph/m2/`)
- **Smart accounts** — ERC-165, ERC-1271, EIP-712 (skeletons in `contracts/m2/`)
- **Demo** — Slashing harness, query metrics via subgraph; testnet in [specs/TESTNET-ADDRESSES.md](../TESTNET-ADDRESSES.md)
